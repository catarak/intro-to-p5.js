## Essential Questions
- What is computation? What is programming?
- Why use programming as a tool to make art?
- Who creates software?
- How can we use programming in our daily lives?
- What is p5.js? Why p5.js?

## Introduction
In this workshop, we will be using p5.js to create interactive visual sketches. We will learn the basics of JavaScript code syntax to draw shapes, and use mous interaction.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
**Target Audience**: high school students, familiar with creative coding but no programming experience.
**Prerequisites**: familiarity using computers to write text. 

### Outcomes & Goals
Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of writing and reading code syntax. They will also gain understanding in how to translate visual ideas and drawings into code. They will understand how to position and scale shapes, as well as use numbers to create colors, and add mouse interaction and randomness to their work. 

### Pacing / Duration
* ~15 min - Getting comfortable with the p5.js Web Editor, and looking at code syntax
  * JavaScript vs p5.js
  * createCanvas
  * what is a pixel?
  * background
* ~15 min - Drawing shapes and positioning
  * where is the origin? what are the axes?
  * x and y positioning a circle
  * changing size of circle
  * width and height variables
  * ellipse, square, rect, triangle
  * stroke, strokeWidth, strokeWeight
  * arc??
* ~15 min Color
  * grayscale color
  * color as text
  * RGB colors - mixing light, versus RYB - mixing paint
  * translating colors from a color picker to your sketch
* ~10 min Layering and order
  * making more complicated shapes via layering shapes
* 

Number of total hours the unit will take in a typical workshop session(s). Please try to take into account transition time between instruction and hands on exercises if any prep is necessary.

- Break down of the class schedule example: 
  - :15 Overview, context, examples and vocabulary 
  - :20 Instruction & hands on exercise 
  - :15 Wrap-up discussion & sharing, reflection or journal and next steps
  
  Overall steps and stuff to teach:
  - look at default code. 
  - createCanvas: it's what we're drawing on, and how big it is, what is a pixel
  - positioning: origin is in upper left-hand corner, y positive is down. 
  - circle, x and y position, and size
  - order matters! show putting background after circle
  - parentheses and semicolons are important.
  - different shapes - rectangles, triangles.
    - layering shapes, order matters
  - stroke vs noStroke
  - looking at p5 documentation
  - colors (maybe this should be earlier)
  - colors as text
  - colors as numbers
  - how to choose a color from the internet
  - use mousePosition to do something
  - how can you map mousePosition to something interesting with a portrait?? could map
    - color
    - shape
    - size (need to use map function, and this feels hard)
  - random(), map()

## Materials Needed
* Laptops or desktop computers for each student. 
* Create an account on the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

### Exercises To Do Before Class
* Read the [p5.js Community Statement](https://p5js.org/community/).
* Look at the [p5.js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) and get familiar with what you can do with the library. 

### Vocabulary
* Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs. 
* Creative programming
* JavaScript
* Color
* Shape
* Interaction

## Exercise Descriptions
* Getting comfortable with p5.js
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. Similar to pacing but with more description of steps.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next level and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.

* Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
  * First Steps - a simple exercise
  * Next Steps - medium exercise
  * Big Steps - a challenge or open ended study
* Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (Instagram, Tumblr...)? 
* Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what theyâ€™ve learned in some creative way?
