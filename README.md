## Essential Questions
- What is computation? What is programming?
- Why use programming as a tool to make art?
- Who creates software?
- How can we use programming in our daily lives?
- What is p5.js? Why p5.js?

## Introduction
In this workshop, we will be using p5.js to create interactive visual sketches. We will learn the basics of JavaScript code syntax to draw shapes, and use mous interaction.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
**Target Audience**: high school students, familiar with creative coding but no programming experience.

**Prerequisites**: familiarity using computers to write text. 

### Outcomes & Goals
Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of writing and reading code syntax. They will also gain understanding in how to translate visual ideas and drawings into code. They will understand how to position and scale shapes, as well as use numbers to create colors, and add mouse interaction and randomness to their work. 

### Pacing / Duration
* ~15 min - Getting comfortable with the p5.js Web Editor, and looking at code syntax
  * JavaScript vs. p5.js
  * `createCanvas()` - what are arguments? 
  * what is a pixel?
  * `background()`
  * adding a comment
  * copying and pasting
* ~15 min - Drawing shapes and positioning
  * where is the origin? what are the axes?
  * x and y positioning a `circle()`
  * changing size of circle
  * width and height variables
  * `ellipse()`, `square()`, `rect()`, `triangle()`
  * `arc()` maybe??
* ~15 min Color
  * grayscale color - 0 to 255
  * color as text - "red", "blue"
  * RGB colors - mixing light, versus RYB - mixing paint

  * Translating colors from a [color picker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) to your sketch
  * `stroke()`, `strokeWeight()`, `fill()`, `noFill()`, `noStroke()`
* ~15 min Layering and order
  * Order matters!!
  * `fill()` order, and so on
  * Making more complicated shapes via layering shapes
* ~15 min Adding randomness
  * using `random()` to get a random background color
  * calling `random()` in `setup()` vs. `draw()`
* ~15 min Getting mouse position
  * getting `mouseX` and `mouseY`
  * using this to position a shape
  * `background()` in `setup()` vs. `draw()`
* ~30 - 45 min Free work time
  * Creating a self-portraint in p5.js Try to add randomness or mouse interaction. 

## Materials Needed
* Laptops or desktop computers for each student. 
* Create an account on the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

### Exercises To Do Before Class
* Read the [p5.js Community Statement](https://p5js.org/community/).
* Look at the [p5.js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) and get familiar with what you can do with the library.
* Look at the inspiration section. What can you make with p5.js?

### Vocabulary
* Program (or Coding): A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs. 
* Creative coding: programming to create something expressive instead of something functional.
* JavaScript: a high-level programming language. It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world!
* Color
* Shape
* Interaction: an action that has an effect on something else
* Randomness: unpredictability

## Exercise Descriptions
* Workshop
  * Getting grounded in p5.js - Understanding what a sketch is and how the code maps to something visual. 
  * Basic shapes - Using code syntax to draw shapes, and how to position and scale them on a canvas.
  * Using colors - How to define colors as numbers, how to use RGB colors. 
  * Adding randomness - Computers are really good at producing random numbers. How to use this for visual art?
  * Adding interaction - How to use mouse interaction in your sketch
* Free work exercise: Create a self-portrait in p5.js using basic shapes. How can you layer shapes to make it look more realistic? How can you create something to look more cartoonish or stylized?
